# Leading-Causes-of-Death-In-NYC

**Are you curious about the leading causes of death in New York City? A dataset I pulled from NYC Open Data provides a window
into the various factors that contribute to mortality rates in the city. With columns including the year, number of deaths, 
leading cause, death rate (per 100,000 people), and age-adjusted death rate (per 100,000 people), this dataset offers a wealth of 
information about the health of New Yorkers. From heart disease to homicides, see my explorations to uncover patterns and insights 
about the state of public health in the Big Apple.**

## Questions 

**As I delved into the vast dataset of New York's mortality rates, I was overwhlemed by the sheer amount of information. I let my curiosity guide me towards uncovering valuable insights about the city's health and well-being. I formulated a series of questions
that I believe will reveal fascinating patterns and trends, shedding light on the most pressing health concerns facing New Yorkers today.**

- What were the top three leading causes of death ?
- Do women or men have higher mortality rates ? (If so, what were the leading causes)
- Which years had the highest mortality rates and if so how did change as years went on ?
- What was the correlation between ethnicity and leading causes ?
- Which specific leading causes correlated with highest amount of deaths ?
- Which leading causes correlated with which ethnicities ?
 
 ** These were a few questions I derived from looking at the data at first glance. Through cleaning, processing, and analyzing it I wrote many queries to find valuable isights and patterns that could aid me in seeing the mortality rates in NYC.**

## Insights

- Diseases of the Heart and Malignant Neoplasms (Cancer: C00-C97) were the two leading causes of death in New York City. Both male and females both have a high number of deaths from both of these leading causes.
- Surprisingly there were variation between male and female death rates in total and from 2007 through 2019. 
- From diving deep into the data, I found that Mental and Behavorial Issues due to Alcohol & Asault ( Homicide) from the data were primarily in the Black Non-Hispanic & Hispanic communities. 
- Also , we see that death rates and total deaths were at a high from 2007 through 2010. Since then, they have gone down and haven't reached those numbers through 2019.
