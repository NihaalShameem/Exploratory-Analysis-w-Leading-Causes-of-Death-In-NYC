# Leading-Causes-of-Death-In-NYC


## Background
**When I begun learning data analytics I always wanted to delve deeper into healthcare data. I came across this dataset that dealt with the leading causes of death in New York City. I pulled this dataset from NYC Open Data which provided a window into the various factors that contribute to mortality rates in the city. With data columns including the year, number of deaths, leading cause, death rate (per 100,000 people), and age-adjusted-death-rate, this dataset offered a wealth of information about the health of New Yorkers. From heart disease to homicides, take a look at my exploration to uncover patterns and insights about the state of public health in the Big Apple.**

## Plan 

**As I delved into the dataset of New York's mortality rates, I formulated a series of questions that I believed would reveal fascinating patterns and trends, shedding light on the most pressing health concerns facing New Yorkers today.**
- What are the top three leading causes of death in the city?
- Do women or men have higher mortality rates ? *If so how do the percentages of gender deaths vary based on the leading cause and the year?*
- Which years had the highest mortality rates and how did that number change over the course of years? *Did years and death have a negative or positve correlation...*
- How does ehtnicity play a role in mortality rates throughout the years?
 
 **These were a few questions I derived from looking at the data at first glance. Through cleaning, processing, and analyzing it I wrote many queries and formulated pivot tables to find valuable insights and patterns that could aid me in seeing the mortality rates in NYC.**

## Insights

- Diseases of the Heart at a whopping **234,888** deaths and Malignant Neoplasms (Cancer: C00-C97) at **171,968** were the two **leading causes** of death in New York City.
- From querying the data and making my dashboard I found that from mental and behavioral issues due to substance abuse had a major discrepency between males and females. Males accounted for **82.25%** of deaths while females only **17.75%.**
- Likewise, Intentional Self Harm (Suicide) had an even bigger percent differnce between male and females. Out of total death percentage by self harm, males accounted for **90.01%** while females had **9.99%** mortality percentage. 
- **2018** had the highest mortality rate at a whopping **55,000 deaths**. There was a positive correlation in that as years passed mortality rates increased.
